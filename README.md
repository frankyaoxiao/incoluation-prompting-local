# Inoculation Prompting

This repo implements inoculation prompting in multiple settings. For settings that aren't included in the repo, download the code [here](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=RgOHRYHX5L&name=supplementary_material)

Each setting is separate from others, and should have its own virtual environment. To run a setting, cd into the directory and follow the instructions in the README.
