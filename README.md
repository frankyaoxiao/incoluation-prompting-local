# Inoculation Prompting

This repo implements Inoculation Prompting ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05024)) in the settings described in that paper.

Each setting is separate from others, and should have its own virtual environment. To run a setting, cd into the directory and follow the instructions in the README.
